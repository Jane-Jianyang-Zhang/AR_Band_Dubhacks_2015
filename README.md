# AR_Band_Dubhacks_2015 

This is the 2015 Dubhacks project created by Jane Jianyang Zhang, Eric Yan, Si Ricki Xie, and Adam Riddle.

This project augments the Microsoft Band dy displaying live biometric data on top on the Band's screen.
We do this by collecting data real-time such as heart rate, skin temperature, calories burned...etc provided by the user wearing the Band and we send the data to Firebase. 
Using a Unity program, we can fetch data from Firebase and display biometric data in augmented reality using the Microsoft Band as our target.

This gives a different dimension to viweing data on the Microsoft Band and other devices.
